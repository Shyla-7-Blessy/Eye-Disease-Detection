# Eye-Disease-Detection
Ophthalmic diseases like diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and AMD threaten vision health, especially in underserved areas. This project uses deep learning models like EyeDeepNet and RetinaNet to automate retinal disease detection. Integrated into the Reti-Revive platform, these models offer high accuracy and early diagnosis support.
